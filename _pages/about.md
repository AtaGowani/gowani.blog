<p>Hello 👋🏽 my name is Ata and I am a software engineer interested in all things privacy and security. Outside of technology, I spend time exploring the conundrums of life alongside different philosophers and through the lense of religion with a focus on Islam. This blog serves as a way for me to sort out and share my thoughts related to those interests in a (somewhat) organized manner.</p>
